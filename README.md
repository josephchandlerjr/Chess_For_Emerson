# Chess for Emerson

A chess game I built for my six year old daughter. It's attached to a simple chess
engine that:

* Validates moves (Including En Passant and Castling)
* Executes random moves as black or white (or neither if you wish to move both)
* Highlights possible moves for player
* Recognizes Checkmate vs Draw
